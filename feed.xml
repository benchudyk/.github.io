        <description>Acoustic panels for several different industries from home studios to restaurants. Primacoustic is a sister company to Radial Engineering that needed some serious updates. The final product uses wordpress for the CMS. I designed the site and helped with some front end development. I directed the team and reported to the owner for each stage of the process. There was roughly 250 pages and post types full of content so planning was key. We separated products as a post type so that we could manipulate the products for future apps like a room calculator and graphic price list. </description>
